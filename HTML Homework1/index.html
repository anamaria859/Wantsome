        Do you remember, as a young child, that one fantastical story which captured your imagination? Of course you do,
        because it’s the story that molded your childhood. It’s the story that filled you with a new
        wonder about the world around you, and of all that was possible. For me it was the story of <strong><i>Robin
                Hood</i></strong>. It had
        adventure, dashing heroes, young love, forests to explore, castles, and evil villains. I read many versions of
        Robin Hood in my youth and have probably watched every movie or TV show made on the subject. It’s stories like
        these that help us—when we’re children trying to understand the world—to discover our own role in the world.<br>
        <br>
        <u><cite>MY GRANDMOTHER ASKED ME TO TELL YOU SHE’S SORRY</cite> by Fredrik Backman</u> captures the wonder and
        joy these kinds of stories have for us. Now, I know <strong><i>MY GRANDMOTHER</i></strong> is strictly a fiction
        novel, there’s no
        fantasy, not even any unexplainable events—just so you know, because I don’t want you to read it expecting that.
        But I’m sure you do remember what it was like to have those fantastical stories of your youth permeate your life
        and shape the kind of person you want to be. This is the book that will help you re-live those days.</p>
